# AVC-Challenge


Here is our AVC checklists
###Week 1 Checklist

- []: All: Complete AVC Plan
- [x]: Sam: Organise follow up group meeting and ensure plan is completed and signed by all members /n
- []: Quan, Jules: Write code for straight forward movement of the robot (as we cant use example file)
- [x]: Quan : Ask Arthur and tutors how to get the ipaddress of the RPI for the future and write it down on the commandline file
- []: Quan : Ask Arthur and tutors where to store code-files on the RPi and how to import the RPi library
- []: Quan : find out how the makefile works 
- []: Quan, Jules: Try to get the RPi emulators running at home.
### week 1 comments (to be updated)

** makefiles is a list of commands for the shell (in our case UNIX Shell). Typing the command "make" will execute the commands listed in the makefile. 

** Note that Arthur's makefile contains the compiling command, that's why we have to execute it first before our AVC txt code so it compile first and add the new changes.

** command "ifconfig" gives you the ip address of the RPi, it has to be connected to the network though and constantly update for the code [obviously you either need to connect the RPi from the station computer (one at the entrance) or to the monitor and keyboard in any PC]
