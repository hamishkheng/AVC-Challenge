# AVC-Challenge


Here is our AVC checklists
###Week 1 Checklist

- [x]: All: Complete AVC Plan
- [x]: Sam: Organise follow up group meeting and ensure plan is completed and signed by all members /n
- [x]: Quan, Jules: Write code for straight forward movement of the robot (as we cant use example file)
- [x]: Quan : Ask Arthur and tutors how to get the ipaddress of the RPI for the future and write it down on the commandline file
- [x]: Quan : Ask Arthur and tutors where to store code-files on the RPi and how to import the RPi library
- [x]: Quan : find out how the makefile works 
- [x]: Quan, Jules: Try to get the RPi emulators running at home.
### week 1 comments (to be updated)

** makefile is a list of commands for the shell (in our case UNIX Shell) sort of like a book of instructions the shell follows so we don't have to type the same commands repeatedly. The command "make" will execute the commands listed in the makefile. 

** Note that Arthur's makefile contains the compiling command, that's why we have to execute it first before our AVC txt code so it compile first and add the new changes.

** command "ifconfig" gives you the ip address of the RPi, it has to be connected to the network though and constantly update for the code [obviously you either need to connect the RPi from the station computer (one at the entrance) or to the monitor and keyboard in any PC]

-Jules has asked received the method to locate the IPAddress on the RPi, and it has been updated onto the commandlineinstructions file
-Jules has also found out how the makefile works
-Jules has also wrote the initial code
- Emulator seems to not be of help, as we actually don't know what to do with it just yet

###Week 2 checklist

- [x] Sam: Arrange follow up meeting, outline plan for following week
- [x] Jules, Quan: Update github with progress from last meeting
- [x] Nikhil, Hamish: Assemble hardware, prototype design for chassis 

###Week 2 comments 

- Quan and Jules have updated gitHub
- Hardware team have not finished their designs, was carried onto week three
- Little to do as there was the mid term break

###Week 3 checklist (Quadrant 1)

- [] (All) Write Methods section (robot description)
- [x] Sam: overlook team progress, plan for following week, keep github updated
- [x] Jules: Develop robot movement code and networking code
- [] Quan:  Tidy up and refine robot movement code, and also networking code if have time
- [x] Hamish, Nikhil: Start building the chassis, characterise motors, prototype designs & hardware

** We started building the actual robot with the final concept later than we expected.

** We essentially stuck with the pre-made robot for testing and later constructed the actual product when most of the testing was        done. 

###Week 4 checklist (Quadrant 2)

- [] (All): Write Discussion/Results section
- [] Sam: provide help to both hardware and software where needed, ensure members are on track for progress report
- [] Jules: further develope movement code for quadrant 2 & 3
- [] Quan: refine movement code to ensure quadrant 2 completion and develope for quadrant 3
- [x] Hamish, Nikhil: finalise designs and continue printing chassis parts, designs IR sensor mounts

** The concepts were all finalised. The actual 3D models were different from the ones draw as a hard copy. We basically simplified it    down due to time constraints and resources. 

** Printing was delayed as there were a limited amount of printers and one printer was dysfunctional. This further decreased the         amount of time we could work on our project pushing us back further.

###Week 5 checklist (Quadrant 3) (Progress Report Due)

- [] (All): Hand in progress report/re-write final report based on feedback 
- [] Sam: continue providing help to both hardware and software, ensure github is maintained
- [] Jules: continue developing movement code for quadrant 3 and adapt for quadrant 4
- [] Quan: continue developing movement code for quadrant 3 and adapt for quadrant 4
- [] Hamish, Nikhil: continue/finish printing parts for chassis, make any changes necessary changes for better performance

###Week 6 checklist (Quadrant 4)

- [] (All): continue re-writing final report based on progress feedback
- [] Sam: ensure both hardware and software are meeting requirments, continue providing help and keep github updated
- [] Jules: finish code for quadrant 4 and 3 so robot and traverse maze
- [] Quan: fix any bugs in code as well as supply help for movement code quadrant 4
- [] Hamish, Nikhil: finish printing hardware and assemble
