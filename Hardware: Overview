Hardware: Overview 

Hardware team: Nikhil and Hamish

Goal(s): 
  - Design a robot that was enviromentally friendly and recyclable 
  - Design a robot with functional aesthetic 
  - Design a robot that is efficient for the software team to program
  - 

Plan: 
  - Make suitable designs for robot
  - Concepts and designs must be functional aesthetic 
  - Consider aesthetics and recyclabulity when conceptualising ideas 
  - Make it compact and neat so it is simple to manage and use
  - 3D print a majority of the parts

What we did: 
  - Drawing up ideas and concepts on paper (hardcopy) 
  - Research: learnt to use freeCAD, gathered measurements and other relevant data for coming up with concepts such as reviewing past
    years designs and putting all the constraints and specifications in to consideration
  - Create 3D prints on freeCAD
  - Print them out on the 3D printers 
  - Construct once all the components are complete 

Concpets(designs and ideas): 
  - Chassis 
  - base (last minute add-on) 
  - IR hinges 
  - Frame 

Tools/Equipemnt/components:
  - nuts and bolts
  - screw drivers
  - drill (mailny used 3mm or 2.5mm drill bits)
  - soldering iron and solder
  - hot glue gun and glue sticks
  - 3D printer and filament  
  - RaspberryPi 
  - Wires 
  - Camera
  - IR sensor (2 or 3 - 2)
  - Wheels(large or small - large)
  - Ball bearing
  - Paint: red  
  - FreeCAD (3D modelling software) 

Specifications:
  - 

What we expected/wanted: 
  - 

Issues:
  - Overheating 
  - Motors (wires) 
  - 3D parts (wrong size - minor miscalculations) 
  - 3D parts (too flimsy/weak)
