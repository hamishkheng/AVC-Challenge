Hardware: Overview 

Hardware team: Nikhil and Hamish 

(Not necesarrily in chronological order) 

Goal(s): 
  - Design a robot that was enviromentally friendly and recyclable 
  - Design a robot with functional aesthetic 
  - Design a robot that is efficient for the software team to program
  - Assemble, complete robot to fit the overall goal(finish the maze) and test it

Plan: 
  - Make suitable designs for robot
  - Concepts and designs must be functional aesthetic 
  - Consider aesthetics and recyclabulity when conceptualising ideas 
  - Make it compact and neat so it is simple to manage and use
  - 3D print a majority of the parts

What we did: 
  - Drawing up ideas and concepts on paper (hardcopy) 
  - Research: learnt to use freeCAD, gathered measurements and other relevant data for coming up with concepts such as reviewing past
    years designs and putting all the constraints and specifications in to consideration
  - Create 3D prints on freeCAD
  - Print them out on the 3D printers 
  - Construct once all the components are complete 

Concpets(designs and ideas): 
  - Chassis 
  - base (last minute add-on) 
  - IR hinges 
  - Frame 

Tools/Equipemnt/components:
  - nuts and bolts
  - screw drivers
  - drill (mailny used 3mm or 2.5mm drill bits)
  - soldering iron and solder
  - hot glue gun and glue sticks
  - 3D printer and filament  
  - RaspberryPi 
  - Wires 
  - Camera
  - IR sensor (2 or 3 - 2)
  - Wheels(medium or small - medium)
  - Ball bearing
  - Paint: red  
  - FreeCAD (3D modelling software) 

Specifications: (final)
  - 2x IR sensors (angled)  
  - Chassis:
    Width - 70mm
    Height (battery holder inclusive) - 35mm
    Length - 120mm
  - Base: 
    Width - 70mm
    Height(legs/Pillars) - 40mm  
    Length - 100mm
  - Wheels:
    Diameter - 50mm
  - 1x PiCamera 
  - RaspberryPi 
    
What we expected/wanted: (expand in decisions)  
  - We wanted 3 IR sensors 
  - Used the small wheels for speed
  - To have a frame 
  - Chassis to be the correct size (partial) 
  - Printing to be done around week 5
  - Complete and assemble by week 6
  - Test and modify in week 7

Issues:
  - Overheating 
  - Motors (wires) 
  - 3D parts (wrong size - minor miscalculations) 
  - 3D parts (too flimsy/weak)  

Decisions: 
  - Changed to 2 IR sensors because the team realised that it would easier to program and manage othe robot
  - Changed from small wheels to medium sized wheels because the team realised that it would be more beneficial for our robot
  - Intended to have a frame bit did not make one bcuase of time constraints and availability of 3D printers
  - Made minor errors in calculating the size of the chassis so had to make a last minute decision to 3D print a base for the 
    RaspberryPi to be place on
  - Printing was done on the second to last week because the 3D printers were in constant use and it took a long time before 
    the team was able to access one
  - Assemble was on the last week due to a hold back from the printing
  - Testing and modiyfying was on the last week to and was done during the assemly of the robot so had to make on the spot 
    decisions for the robot as the team was pressed for time
