### Basic linux commands
- ls (list directory)
- cd (change directory)
- pwd (prints current working directory)
- nano (open nano T.E)
- rm (remove file)
- ./filename (executes filename)
- man program (shows manual for a programm)

### Compiling via command line:
- nano example.c (creates 'example.c' file)
- gcc -o example example.c (compiles file under the name 'example')
- ./example ( runs the file)

### Compiling via makefile(JULES PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW A MAKEFILE WORKS USING COMMENTS TY xoxoxo):
- nano makefile ( creates a makefile )
// makefiles is a list of commands for the shell (in our case UNIX Shell). Typing the command "make" will execute the commands listed in the makefile. 
** Note that Arthur's makefile contains the compiling command, that's why we have to execute it first before our AVC txt code so it compile first and add the new changes.
- example:example.c
- (remember to use tab) gcc -o example example.c
- make
- ./example

### Using SSH to transfer code to pi (using git clone)
- ssh username@ipaddress
- Will ask for password or RSA confirmation
- use git clone
- don't know what else yet

### HOW TO GET IP ADDRESS OF THE RPi (TO BE DONE BY QUAN)) [130.195.3.118 <<== IP Address]
- 

### WHERE TO STORE FILES ON RPI AND HOW TO IMPORT LIBRARY  (To be done by quan)

###there is also an emulator that is on the ENGR 101 fb page, ill sort it out soon.
